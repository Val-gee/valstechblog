# The Tech Blog

## Description

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases for personal or professional projects. Reading and sharing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies can help developers gain insight from other developers. There are countless articles and websites that fail to provide a plaform where developers can gather and share their ideas and experience on projects they might be working on or are interested in starting.

This site was built as a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. This site was built completely from scratch and is deployed to Heroku. My app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. User will be asked to create a unique login username and password to access the full functionality of the site.

## Mock-Up

The following demonstrates a screenshot of the deployed application:
